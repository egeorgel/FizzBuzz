# Fizz Buzz Kata

###### Version 1
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz"

###### Version 2
Change the program so that for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

###### Version 3
Change the program so that I can define the rule at Runtime for which multiple will stand for "Fizz" (not necessarily 3) and which multiple stands for "Buzz" (not necessarily 5). 
If no rule is provided at Runtime, it should work like v2, with the (3 ; 5) configuration.
